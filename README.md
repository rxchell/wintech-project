## Workflow:
### Frontend 
- routing + pages 
- integrate tailwind CSS styles into pages
- product card 

### Backend 
- tech stack (database)
- set up backend
- one API point accessible locally that can retrieve data

## What was used 
- HTML creates and structures the website's content
- CSS adds style and formatting to these structures
- `Javascript` turns those stylized components into something that a user can interact with
- MongoDB
- File format: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays
